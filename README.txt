Note:
The following external JSON library used for this program: "JSON.simple".
More information about this library can be obtained from the following URL: https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/
The built Jar file for this library was provided as a convenience: "json-simple-1.1.1.jar".

Instructions:
1) Include the location of the saved "json-simple-1.1.1.jar" file in your current CLASSPATH environment variable.
2) Get the Java source files in the "src" folder and compile them locally (e.g. javac *.java).
3) Run the program. Usage: 'java -classpath <CLASSPATH> ViewParsingApp <FILENAME>', or 'java ViewParsingApp <FILENAME>' if you have already set your CLASSPATH environment variable.
4) You can exit the program by entering "quit" (case insensitive) at any time.

From the 2 non-required (i.e. optional) features, I implemented selector chaining (equivalent to CSS "descendant selector").
